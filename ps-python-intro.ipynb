    "As you can tell from the previous, indexing rows based on indices is only useful when you know the specific set of rows that you need, and you can only really get a range of entries. Working with data often involves huge datasets, making it inefficient and sometimes impossible to know exactly what indices to be looking at. On top of that, most data analysis concerns itself with looking for patterns or specific conditions in the data, which is impossible to look for with simple index based sorting.   "
